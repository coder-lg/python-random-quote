Responsive is better than fast
It’s not fully shipped until it’s fast
Anything added dilutes everything else
Practicality beats purity
Approachable is better than simple
Mind your words, they are important
Speak like a human
Half measures are as bad as nothing at all
Encourage flow
Non-blocking is better than blocking
Favor focus over features
Avoid administrative distraction
Design for failure
Keep it logically awesome
The purpose of our lives is to be happy.
Life is what happens when you’re busy making other plans.
Get busy living or get busy dying.
You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.
Many of life’s failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.
If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal, not to people or things.
Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game.
Money and success don’t change people; they merely amplify what is already there.
Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people’s thinking.
Not how long, but how well you have lived is the main thing.
If life were predictable it would cease to be life, and be without flavor.
The whole secret of a successful life is to find out what is one’s destiny to do, and then do it.
In order to write about life first you must live it.
The big lesson in life, is never be scared of anyone or anything.
